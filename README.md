Data sharing isn't spooky! Open Science October is frightfully fun event to practice and showcase your data viz skills. For 4 weeks in October, we will feature one dataset from [LDbase.org](LDbase.org) and challenge all who wish to participate to create a data visualization! Those who participate will be sent LDbase merch and be entered in a raffle to win a giftcard.
