# Week 2 - Comorbid Reading and Math Difficulty
Week 2 of #OpenScienceOctober features the [Comorbid Reading and Math Difficulty at the Start of First Grade](https://ldbase.org/projects/6238a896-f1cc-4cf9-9c52-b23fede10747) data set!

# Project Description
**LDbase Project Page**: [Improving the Academic Performance of First-Grade Students with Reading and Math Difficulty](https://ldbase.org/projects/6238a896-f1cc-4cf9-9c52-b23fede10747)

Word reading and math computation ability are two skills that typically develop together.  However, not all children meet developmental benchmarks for these abilities. This study focused on first-grade students with difficulty in both word reading and calculations. The primary purpose was to test a coordinated interventionâ€™s effects against the business-as-usual school program on students' word reading and arithmetic. Students were randomly assigned to 4 conditions: a business-as-usual control group, coordinated treatment across reading & math, reading-only treatment, & math-only treatment. Students in all 4 conditions were tested before intervention began and after it ended; however, the data set presented here includes only the pre-test data collected at the start of first grade.

## Consider This When Engaging with the Data  
1. These data are stored as a .xlsx file which does not internally contain meta-data (e.g., about how variables are coded). Please refer to the codebook below for information about how each variable is coded! 
2. Please note that missing data points are coded as NA.
4. Finally, be sure to cite the data set in your visualization and/or accompanying post on social media (see Citation below!)
