Week 1 of #OpenScienceOctober features the [Home Math Environment Study](https://ldbase.org/projects/49d02437-600d-45ab-ac52-04c91ad6502a)!


# Project Description
**LDbase Project Page**: [Home Math Environment Study](https://ldbase.org/projects/49d02437-600d-45ab-ac52-04c91ad6502a)

Researchers have long studied how at-home family practices can support children's reading development, traditionally including things like number of books in the home, use of the local library, and a rich language environment (collectively, the "home literacy environment.") Less is known about the "home math environment". The purpose of this study was to begin to identify what parents are doing in their home that might be related to their children's math achievement outcomes.

# Dataset
**Link to the Dataset**: [Final Cleaned Data](https://ldbase.org/datasets/28729a95-d898-4271-b16e-dc67be8d8689)
## Consider This When Engaging with the Data  
1. These data are stored as a .csv file which does not internally contain meta-data (e.g., about how variables are coded). Please refer to the codebook below for information about how each variable is coded! 
2. Please note that missing data points are coded as a period (.). If you are using R and would prefer to replace these with NA values, you could use syntax that looks like the following when reading in the data set: data <- read.csv("FinalCleanedData.csv", na.strings=c("."))
3. Finally, be sure to cite the data set in your visualization and/or accompanying post on social media (see Citation below!)

# How do I participate?
-  Take a look at the data and keep an eye out for interesting relationships. Remember, be careful about drawing conclusions about causation!
   -  Take a look at the free resource [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) if you need some help
- **Make a data visualization!**
- **Share** your data viz on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LDbaseRepo), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ldbaserepo/?viewAsMember=true), or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ldbaserepo/) using the hashtags **#OpenScienceOctober**, **#DataSharingIsntSpooky**, and tag LDbase **@LDbaseRepo**!
