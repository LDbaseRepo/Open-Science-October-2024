# Week 4 - Data Sharing Beliefs and Attitudes
Week 4 of #OpenScienceOctober features the [Education Researchers' Beliefs and Barriers towards Data Sharing Project](https://ldbase.org/projects/dbf4158d-5e7b-407e-993d-da559c189a93)! We don't think data sharing is spooky, but some researchers might feel otherwise, even if it is a practice that is highly encouraged and increasingly becoming required for federally funded research projects. Prior research suggests that researchers believe data sharing should be practiced often, but many researchers rarely practice it. This project collected data to examine the barriers education researchers may have from engaging in data sharing as a practice.

# Project Description

**LDbase Project Page**: [Education Researchers' Beliefs and Barriers towards Data Sharing Project](https://ldbase.org/projects/dbf4158d-5e7b-407e-993d-da559c189a93)  
**Preregistration**: [Data Management Practices of Education Researchers](https://osf.io/8r746)   
**Associated Publications**: [Education Researchers' Beliefs and Barriers towards Data Sharing (Preprint)](https://osf.io/preprints/edarxiv/8y6fd)    

The Education Researchers' Beliefs and Barriers towards Data Sharing project examines the prevalence of positive attitudes and perceived barriers to data sharing in a sample of education researchers (n=178) . The data for this project comes from a larger study that surveyed researchers on a host of topics related to data stewardship. This project is particularly relevant for Open Science October, since LDbase itself is a repository meant to house data for and support education and developmental science researchers, and the data from this project provides a look into how researchers feel about data sharing.

The featured dataset includes 12 items on a 7-point Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree) about researcher's beliefs and attitudes about data sharing. It also includes information about the participant's field of study, area of research, workplace, years of experience, the types of data they work with, and the types of grants they work on.
